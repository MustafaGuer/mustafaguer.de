            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am 32 years old and am managing my own Taxi Limousine service based in Munich. After the pandemic
                affected so strongly in my Life, I did decide to go back to my roots in IT. Over the last year, I built
                a
                variety of Front-End projects from simple websites to complex web apps. Now I'm looking for new
                challenges in Front-End-Web development.</p>
