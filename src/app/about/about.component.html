            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am 32 year old IT professional. Over the last years, I managed my own Taxi Limousine service based in
                Munich. During the pandemic, I did decide to go fully back to my roots into IT and work on software
                development projects. Thus, over the last year, I built a variety of Front-End projects from simple
                websites to complex web apps. Now I'm looking for new challenges in Front-End-Web development.</p>
